## Wost Popup Ever

A stupid demo of using [WebGazer.js](http://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/) to get a popup to follow a website visitors eyes around the page.

As [Dan pointed out](https://twitter.com/DanHarper7/status/735744641325113345) this doesn't work without a secure connection. But it'll work locally so fork it to see the demo.
